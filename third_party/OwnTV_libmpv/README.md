OwnTV libmpv is the **mpv playback engine** of [OwnTV](https://github.com/ahXN00/OwnTV), the
open-source IPTV **player** for Android TV and phones: [mpv](https://mpv.io/) and
[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) compiled for Android, with the small Kotlin/JNI wrapper the apps talk to.
It is built from [jarnedemeulemeester/libmpv-android](https://github.com/jarnedemeulemeester/libmpv-android)
and published as `tv.own.owntv:libmpv`. [OwnTV Core](https://github.com/ahXN00/OwnTV_Core)'s
`:player-core` uses it; both apps get it from there and never name it themselves.

> **Keeping it current is a monthly job — [UPDATING.md](UPDATING.md) is the procedure.**

> ⚠️ OwnTV provides **no** channels, playlists, subscriptions, streams or media content. This is a
> player engine; the sources are the user's own.

## ✨ Why OwnTV builds its own

| What OwnTV needs | Upstream — jarnedemeulemeester/libmpv-android 1.0.0 | **Ours — OwnTV libmpv** |
|---|---|---|
| **The newest mpv.** mpv makes no bug-fix releases; every fix after a release is only on its main branch | 0.41.0 (December 2025) | **newest main branch, checked and updated every month** |
| **Interlaced TV channels without comb lines** (mpv's automatic deinterlacing) | ❌ does not work — the needed FFmpeg filter is missing | ✅ works |
| **Night mode and volume levelling on the mpv player** | ❌ plays silence — FFmpeg filters are missing | ✅ works |
| **Recovery from a frozen stream** — OwnTV starts a fresh player while the frozen one is still shutting down | ✅ | ✅ (same code as upstream) |
| **Newest FFmpeg** (the part that opens and decodes the streams) | 8.1 | **9.0.2** |
| **Rebuildable exactly** — every ingredient pinned to a fixed version | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Download size** (arm64, compressed) | 11.0 MB | 11.3 MB |
| **How often it gets updated** | whenever its one maintainer releases (5 times in 27 months) | **every month** ([UPDATING.md](UPDATING.md)) |

## 🔢 Versions compared

What official mpv offers, what the upstream library we forked ships, and what this build ships.
The "ours" column changes with every release — update it in the same commit as `depinfo.sh`.

| | Official mpv | Upstream — jarnedemeulemeester/libmpv-android 1.0.0 | **Ours — OwnTV libmpv** |
|---|---|---|---|
| mpv | newest release **0.41.0** (2025-12-21); no point releases, fixes land on master only | 0.41.0 | **master `3186d369f`** (git-release-373, 2026-10-01), three carried patches |
| FFmpeg | — (newest FFmpeg release: 9.0.2) | 8.1 | **9.0.2**, six carried patches |
| FFmpeg filters | — | none | **29, allowlisted** (deinterlace, rotation, audio dynamics, EQ + plumbing) |
| FFmpeg muxers / encoders | — | none / none | mpegts, matroska / none |
| libplacebo · libass · dav1d | — | 7.360.1 · 0.17.4 · 1.5.3 | 7.360.1 · 0.17.5 · 1.5.4 |
| Several instances at once | — | yes | yes (same JNI) |
| ABIs | — | armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, x86, x86_64 | armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, x86_64 |
| Published as | — | `dev.jdtech.mpv:libmpv` (Maven Central) | `tv.own.owntv:libmpv` (OwnTV Maven, no login) |
| How often it moves | a release every 6–9 months | when its maintainer tags (5 releases in 27 months) | **monthly** ([UPDATING.md](UPDATING.md)) |

## 📦 What's inside

Every version is pinned in [`buildscripts/include/depinfo.sh`](buildscripts/include/depinfo.sh).

- **mpv** — a pinned commit on `master` (`v_mpv`), built with libass and libplacebo; no Lua, no libavdevice, no libcurl,
  no Vulkan. OwnTV carries three patches on top ([`buildscripts/patches/mpv/`](buildscripts/patches/mpv)).
- **FFmpeg** — a release tag (`v_ffmpeg`), `--enable-gpl --enable-version3`, MediaCodec + JNI,
  mbedTLS, dav1d, libxml2 (DASH), six carried patches (MediaCodec and HTTP)
  ([`buildscripts/patches/ffmpeg/`](buildscripts/patches/ffmpeg)). **No encoders.** Muxers: `mpegts` and `matroska` only, so mpv's
  `stream-record` can write what it is already playing. Filters: the allowlist in
  [`buildscripts/scripts/ffmpeg.sh`](buildscripts/scripts/ffmpeg.sh), each commented with who needs it.
  Trimmed by denylists in the same file: video/image decoders IPTV never meets (games, screen capture,
  editing intermediates, still images) and unused protocols; no libavdevice. Every audio and subtitle
  decoder stays.
- **`libowntvffmpeg.so`** — ExoPlayer's FFmpeg audio decoder (Media3 1.11.1's `ffmpeg_jni.cc`) on this
  same FFmpeg, so OwnTV ships one FFmpeg. Its Java half lives in OwnTV_Core (`tv.own.owntv.player.ffmpeg`).
- **Hardening** — every native library is built with `-fstack-protector-strong -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2`
  and a build-id; each release carries the unstripped libraries (`symbols-<abi>.zip`). mbedTLS seeds
  from `/dev/urandom` (its default `/dev/random` can stall HTTPS for minutes on old boxes).
- **ABIs** — `armeabi-v7a`, `arm64-v8a`, `x86_64` (no 32-bit x86, which neither app ships). 64-bit
  libraries are 16 KB page-aligned.
- **minSdk** 26. **Java package** `dev.jdtech.mpv`, kept from upstream on purpose.

### Differences from upstream, in full

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `buildscripts/include/depinfo.sh` | `v_mpv` is a master commit, not a release; no Lua; `v_gas_preprocessor` pinned |
| `buildscripts/include/download-deps.sh` | mpv cloned blobless + checkout of the pinned commit |
| `buildscripts/scripts/ffmpeg.sh` | filter allowlist, `mpegts`/`matroska` muxers; video-decoder and protocol denylists, no libavdevice; armv7 tuned for Cortex-A53 |
| `buildscripts/build.sh` | no 32-bit x86; stack protector + FORTIFY (`CPPFLAGS`), `--build-id`; `--exclude-libs`, `--gc-sections`, packed relocations |
| `buildscripts/scripts/mbedtls.sh` | `/dev/urandom` (as mpv-android `db7df51`); hardening flags |
| `buildscripts/patches/mpv/0001-revert-hls-manifest-through-stream.patch` | undoes mpv `13a4bfbc1`: with it, IPTV panels answer 403 on every HLS segment |
| `buildscripts/patches/mpv/0002-audiotrack-no-spin-on-underrun.patch` | an audio underrun no longer burns a whole CPU core in a write loop |
| `buildscripts/patches/mpv/0003-estimated-vf-fps-from-timestamp-gaps.patch` | a film whose file states no frame rate still reports one, so Auto frame rate can switch |
| `buildscripts/patches/ffmpeg/0001-…`, `0002-…` | a MediaCodec decoder that stalls (Realtek, TCL) fails after 3 s of one unbroken stall instead of locking the player; mpv then decodes in software |
| `buildscripts/patches/ffmpeg/0003-http-a-finished-chunked-body-is-not-premature.patch` | HLS with chunked playlists opens instead of re-fetching a complete playlist until the open times out |
| `buildscripts/patches/ffmpeg/0004-mediacodec-open-the-decoder-adaptive.patch` | H.264 above 30 fps plays at full rate on the TCL (the decoder is opened with max-width/max-height, as ExoPlayer does) |
| `buildscripts/patches/ffmpeg/0005-mediacodec-hevc-without-extradata.patch` | an HEVC stream joined mid-way opens instead of aborting the app |
| `buildscripts/patches/ffmpeg/0006-mediacodec-wait-for-the-first-keyframe.patch` | new decoder option `wait_keyframe`: a catch-up archive that starts mid-GOP stays on the hardware decoder |
| `libmpv/src/main/cpp/ffmpeg_jni.cc`, `CMakeLists.txt` | new — `libowntvffmpeg.so`, ExoPlayer's FFmpeg audio decoder for OwnTV_Core |
| `libmpv/src/main/cpp/main.cpp` | mpv's log follows the app's `msg-level` (upstream always asked for verbose) |
| `libmpv/src/main/cpp/event.cpp`, `jni_utils.*`, `MPVLib.kt` | end of file reaches the app with its reason and error code (`EventObserver.endFile`, no-op by default) |
| `libmpv/build.gradle.kts`, `build.gradle.kts`, `gradle/libs.versions.toml` | publishes `tv.own.owntv:libmpv` to OwnTV's Maven repository instead of Maven Central; `abiFilters`; `ndkVersion` read from `depinfo.sh` |
| `buildscripts/scripts/mpv.sh` | `-Dlua=disabled -Dlibavdevice=disabled -Dbuild-date=false` |
| `buildscripts/include/download-sdk.sh` | gas-preprocessor at the pinned commit; `IN_CI` defaults to 0 |
| `renovate.json` | the mpv and Lua rules removed (mpv is bumped by the monthly workflow) |
| `tools/inspect_aar.py` | new — the build contract |
| `tools/publish_pages.py` | new — writes into OwnTV's Maven repository (identical copy in OwnTV_Core) |
| `tools/render_logo.py`, `extras/` | new — this README's logo |
| `.github/workflows/*` | `build`, `publish` (with unstripped `symbols-<abi>.zip`), `monthly-update` (upstream's `publish.yaml` removed) |

Keep this table true: it is what makes an `upstream` merge reviewable.

## ✅ The build contract

Every CI build ends with `tools/inspect_aar.py`, which fails the build unless:

- the AAR holds exactly the three ABIs, every 64-bit `.so` is 16 KB-aligned, nothing links `libvulkan`;
- the mpv inside is the commit pinned in `depinfo.sh`;
- every allowlisted filter is really compiled in (read from FFmpeg's generated `filter_list.c`);
- `libowntvffmpeg.so` is in every ABI, links avcodec / swresample / avutil and exports `JNI_OnLoad`;
- every `.so` has a build-id;
- the decoders, demuxers and protocols IPTV playback needs survived the trim (`MUST_HAVE`, read from
  FFmpeg's generated `codec_list.c`, `demuxer_list.c` and `protocol_list.c`).

It also prints the mpv/FFmpeg versions and the per-ABI size; the publish workflow puts that report in
the GitHub Release notes.

## 🛠️ Building

The native build needs Linux (or macOS); it runs in GitHub Actions. On a Linux machine:

```sh
cd buildscripts
./download.sh        # SDK, NDK and all pinned sources
./patch.sh           # applies buildscripts/patches/
./build.sh           # all ABIs, then the AAR
python3 ../tools/inspect_aar.py ../libmpv/build/outputs/aar/libmpv-release.aar
```

Single component or ABI: `./build.sh -n ffmpeg`, `./build.sh --arch arm64 mpv`, then `./build.sh -n`.

## 🚀 Releasing

Versions are date-based: **`YYYY.MM.N`** (`2026.09.0`, then `2026.10.0`; `N` counts extra releases in
the same month). Push the tag `vYYYY.MM.N` on `main`:

1. `publish.yaml` checks the tag format,
2. runs the full build and contract check (the same `build.yaml` as every push),
3. publishes `tv.own.owntv:libmpv:YYYY.MM.N` to OwnTV's Maven repository (the `gh-pages` branch of
   OwnTV_Core, written with the `CORE_BUMP_TOKEN` secret; the newest 12 versions are kept),
4. creates the GitHub Release with the AAR and the contract report,
5. opens a **"Pin libmpv YYYY.MM.N" pull request on OwnTV_Core**. It never merges itself — a new
   engine waits for the device test.

A published version is immutable. Re-running on a tag that already published stops with "already
published"; fix forward with the next `N`.

## 📥 Consuming it

Public, **no account or token needed**:

```kotlin
// settings.gradle.kts
maven {
    url = uri("https://ahxn00.github.io/OwnTV_Core/maven")
    content { includeGroup("tv.own.owntv") }
}

// gradle/libs.versions.toml
libmpv = { group = "tv.own.owntv", name = "libmpv", version.ref = "libmpv" }
```

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions, bug reports and ideas are welcome. Two things to know before opening a pull request:

- **Never pin a floating source.** Every dependency is a tag or a commit in `depinfo.sh`; a build must
  be reproducible from the tag alone.
- **The JNI stays per-instance.** OwnTV's recovery creates a new mpv while a frozen one is still being
  destroyed; a single global instance aborts the app there.

## 🙏 Credits

This library is a thin layer over other people's excellent work. Thank you to all of them.

- [**mpv**](https://mpv.io/) ([mpv-player/mpv](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv)) — the player itself.
- [**jarnedemeulemeester/libmpv-android**](https://github.com/jarnedemeulemeester/libmpv-android) — the
  Android library this repository is forked from: its build scripts and its multi-instance JNI wrapper.
- [**mpv-android**](https://github.com/mpv-android/mpv-android) — the original Android build scripts
  and JNI code both of the above grew from.
- [**FFmpeg**](https://ffmpeg.org/) — demuxing, decoding and filtering.

The logo's mpv-style mark is OwnTV's own flat drawing in mpv's colours; mpv's own logo belongs to the
mpv project.

### 🎨 Brand

The lowercase **owntv** wordmark was designed for OwnTV by [@m3th0d93](https://github.com/m3th0d93)
in [issue #227](https://github.com/ahXN00/OwnTV/issues/227).

## ⚖️ Legal

OwnTV libmpv is media **player** infrastructure only. It ships with no channels, playlists,
subscriptions or content, and does not endorse or facilitate access to unauthorized streams. Users
of the apps built on it are solely responsible for the sources they add.

## 📄 License

The wrapper code (Kotlin, JNI, build scripts) is **MIT** — see [LICENSE](LICENSE), kept from upstream.

The **binaries are GPLv3 as a whole**: FFmpeg is configured with `--enable-gpl --enable-version3` and
mpv is built with its GPL parts. Anything shipping this AAR ships GPLv3 code and owes its users the
corresponding source: this repository at the release tag plus the pinned upstream sources it names.
